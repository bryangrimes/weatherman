# weatherman.py

`weatherman` is a script that wraps the creation of Elastic Beanstalk stacks
via eb CLI tool. It generates command line parameters based on input and
configuration, then creates Elastic Beanstalk environments.

## Installation

Use `pip install weatherman`.

## Test Suite

The tests use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Install tox,
preferably outside of a virtualenv since it creates virtualenvs for Python 2.7
and Python 3.4.
